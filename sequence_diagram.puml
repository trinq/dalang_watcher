== Step 1: Scan Multiple IPs for Open Ports ==

User -> n8n: Configure IP Watch List\n(100+ target IPs)
n8n -> n8n: Load IP Target List from File
note right of n8n
  target_ips.csv:
  - 203.0.113.10
  - 203.0.113.11
  - 198.51.100.25
  - 192.0.2.100
  ...and ~96 more IPs
end note

loop For Each IP in Target List
    n8n -> API: POST /api/scan/ports\n{target: "${ip}", ports: [20-8080]}
    API -> Scapy: Execute Port Scan on Target
    Scapy -> Network: Scan Target Ports
    Network -> Scapy: Return Port Status
    Scapy -> API: Return Open Port Results
    API -> DB: Store Port State with Timestamp
end

== Step 2: Delta Detection Across Multiple IPs ==

n8n -> n8n: Begin Change Detection Process

loop For Each IP in Target List
    n8n -> API: GET /api/results?target=${ip}
    API -> DB: Query Latest Results for IP
    DB -> API: Return Current Open Ports
    API -> n8n: Return Port Status List
    
    n8n -> DB: Query Previous Scan Results for IP
    DB -> n8n: Return Historical Port Data
    
    n8n -> n8n: Compare Current vs Previous State
    
    alt Changes Detected for This IP
        n8n -> n8n: Add to "Changed IPs" List
    end
end

n8n -> n8n: Aggregate All IP Changes

alt Any Changes Detected
    n8n -> User: Send Consolidated Alert
    note right
      Alert Details:
      - Changed IPs: 2 of 100 monitored
      - 203.0.113.10: New Port 3389 (RDP)
      - 192.0.2.100: New Port 5432 (PostgreSQL)
      - Detected: 2025-03-01 08:11:34
      - Detected by: trinq
    end note
